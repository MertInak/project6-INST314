# project6-INST314
This dataset is a collection of responses from 10 individuals who were asked to read a 
description of three different types of feminism (difference-denying, difference-removing, and difference-honoring) 
and then answer a set of questions about their degree of agreement with each approach, which approach they believe has had the most cultural and political impact, 
and whether they are or have been a mother. The purpose of the dataset is to gather information on individuals' 
views on different approaches to feminism and their personal experiences related to motherhood.
